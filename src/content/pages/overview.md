At [**Anant**](https://anant.us "Anant"), we've been building business platforms since 2010, and these days we have focused on realtime data & analytics platforms that connect to other aspects of a comprehensive modern enterprise's business platform. We've worked on platforms of all sizes: small, medium, large, and even extra-extra-large. We started this playbook to train our team but want to share this as a set of best practices for creating, maintaining, and operating a modern enterprise business platform with a realtime data & analytics platform connecting it all. We present them as 15 Plays, broken out into three categories, in a format inspired by the [Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net), USDS Playbook, and Principled GraphQL.
